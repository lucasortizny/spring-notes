# spring-notes

This repository is for all the Spring related notes to be condensed in a single
location. As it currently stands, the [other repository](https://github.com/lucasortizny/springpractice)
has had the notes separated across the different projects because of the way the tutorial
videos were structured. This is all inspired off of the luv2code Udemy tutorial videos.
